## üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Testing Commands**

Since the API server is running, you can test these commands manually:

```bash
# 1. Check system health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# 2. List LLM providers  
curl http://localhost:8000/api/llm/providers

# 3. Get available providers
curl http://localhost:8000/api/llm/available

# 4. Test root endpoint
curl http://localhost:8000/

# 5. Check API documentation
curl http://localhost:8000/docs
```

## üéØ **CLI Command Patterns**

When the CLI wrapper is working, these would be the command patterns:

```bash
# Health check
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py health

# Provider management
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py providers list
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py providers test --provider ollama

# Skills assessment
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py assess \
  --skill PROG \  
  --evidence "Your professional evidence here..." \
  --provider ollama

# Evidence validation
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py validate \
  --evidence "Evidence to validate..." \
  --skill PROG

# Career guidance
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py career \
  --role "Senior Developer" \
  --experience "5 years full-stack development"

# Interactive chat
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py chat \
  --provider anthropic \
  --message "What skills should I focus on?"

# Batch processing
python scripts/intellisfia-cli.py batch \
  --input assessments.json \
  --output results.json
```

## ‚úÖ **Verification Results**

### **‚úÖ Working Components:**
- API Server running on port 8000
- Health monitoring system active  
- LLM provider detection (Ollama available)
- Provider management endpoints
- Multi-LLM architecture in place

### **üîß Components Being Set Up:**
- CLI wrapper script imports
- Full assessment endpoint chain
- Evidence validation workflows
- Career guidance system
- Conversation memory management

### **üìä Real-World Evidence Quality:**
The scenarios above demonstrate:
- **Quantifiable achievements** (user counts, performance metrics, budget size)
- **Specific technologies** (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes)
- **Leadership evidence** (team sizes, mentoring, process establishment)
- **Business impact** (cost savings, revenue growth, client satisfaction)
- **Career progression** (role evolution, responsibility growth)

## üöÄ **Next Steps for Full CLI Testing:**
1. Fix import issues in CLI wrapper
2. Verify all assessment endpoints are registered
3. Test end-to-end assessment workflows
4. Validate evidence quality scoring
5. Test career guidance recommendations
6. Verify conversation memory functionality

The foundation is solid - the API server is running, providers are detected, and the system is ready for comprehensive CLI testing! üéâ
