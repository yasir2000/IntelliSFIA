# IntelliSFIA Enterprise Production Deployment

## üè¢ Architecture Overview

IntelliSFIA is designed as a microservices-based enterprise application with the following production components:

### Core Services
- **Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript (Nginx served)
- **API Gateway**: FastAPI with authentication & rate limiting
- **SFIA Engine**: Python-based skill analysis and assessment service
- **RDF Service**: Knowledge graph management with SPARQL endpoints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data, GraphDB for RDF triples
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and API caching

### Infrastructure Components
- **Load Balancer**: Nginx with SSL termination
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for microservices communication
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ for async processing
- **File Storage**: MinIO/S3 for document storage
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK Stack
- **Security**: OAuth2/OIDC, JWT tokens, RBAC

## üöÄ Deployment Options
