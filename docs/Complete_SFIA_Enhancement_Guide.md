# Complete SFIA 9 Ontology Enhancement Guide

## Executive Summary

This guide provides a comprehensive analysis of the current SFIA 9 RDF output and detailed recommendations for building complete ontologies for the ISEB SFIA 9 framework. The current implementation provides a solid foundation with 154 triples covering 2 skills, 7 levels, and 2 categories, but significant enhancements are needed for a complete professional competency management system.

## Current State Analysis

### What We Have (Strengths)
✅ **Solid Core Structure**: Well-defined skills, levels, and categories using proper RDF/OWL semantics
✅ **SKOS Compliance**: Proper use of concept schemes for hierarchical organization
✅ **Rich Metadata**: Comprehensive descriptions, guidance notes, and URLs
✅ **Linked Data Ready**: Proper URI structure with dereferenceable identifiers
✅ **Quality Data Model**: Clean separation of skills, skill levels, and attributes

### Current Ontology Structure
```turtle
Base URI: https://rdf.sfia-online.org/9/

Core Classes:
- sfia:Skill (2 instances: ISCO, ITSP)
- sfia:SkillLevel (6 instances: skill-level combinations)
- sfia:Level (7 instances: Levels of Responsibility 1-7)
- sfia:Category (2 instances: strategy_and_architecture, strategy_and_planning)
- Attributes as owl:AnnotationProperty (1 instance: AUTO - Autonomy)

Key Properties:
- sfia:definedAtLevel: Links skills to specific levels
- sfia:skillCategory: Associates skills with categories
- sfia:level: Links skill levels to responsibility levels
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ **154 triples loaded successfully**
- ✅ **No structural errors detected**
- ✅ **All 7 SFIA levels properly defined**
- ✅ **Proper SKOS category hierarchy**
- ⚠️ **Limited to test data (2 skills only)**

## Enhancement Roadmap

### Phase 1: Professional Context (High Priority)

#### 1.1 Professional Roles
**Gap**: No modeling of actual job roles that require SFIA skills
**Enhancement**: Add `sfia:ProfessionalRole` class with skill requirements

```turtle
roles:SoftwareArchitect a sfia:ProfessionalRole ;
    rdfs:label "Software Architect"@en ;
    sfia:roleLevel 6 ;
    sfia:requiresEssentialSkill skilllevels:ITSP_6, skilllevels:ISCO_6 ;
    sfia:requiresDesirableSkill skilllevels:ITSP_5 .
```

#### 1.2 Competency Profiles
**Gap**: No structured way to define skill combinations for roles
**Enhancement**: Add `sfia:CompetencyProfile` for detailed requirements

#### 1.3 Career Pathways
**Gap**: No modeling of career progression between roles
**Enhancement**: Add `sfia:CareerPathway` to show role transitions

### Phase 2: Assessment & Development (Medium Priority)

#### 2.1 Skill Assessment Framework
**Gap**: No way to track actual vs. required competencies
**Enhancement**: Add assessment classes for capability tracking

```turtle
sfia:Assessment a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Skill Assessment"@en .

sfia:SkillGap a owl:Class ;
    rdfs:label "Skill Gap"@en .
```

#### 2.2 Learning Resources
**Gap**: No connection to learning and development materials
**Enhancement**: Link skills to training resources and learning paths

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics (Medium Priority)

#### 3.1 Skill Relationships
**Gap**: No modeling of skill dependencies or complementary skills
**Enhancement**: Add prerequisite and complementary relationships

```turtle
sfia:prerequisiteFor a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain sfia:SkillLevel ;
    rdfs:range sfia:SkillLevel .

sfia:complementaryTo a owl:ObjectProperty ;
    rdfs:domain sfia:Skill ;
    rdfs:range sfia:Skill .
```

#### 3.2 Skill Clusters
**Gap**: No grouping of related skills that work together
**Enhancement**: Add skill clustering for better analysis

### Phase 4: Organizational Context (Lower Priority)

#### 4.1 Organizational Adoption
**Gap**: No modeling of how organizations use SFIA
**Enhancement**: Add organizational structures and business alignment

#### 4.2 Governance Framework
**Gap**: No support for organizational governance of skills
**Enhancement**: Add governance classes and properties

## Implementation Strategy

### Technical Approach

1. **Extend Existing Parsers**: Build on current CSV parsing approach
2. **Maintain Backward Compatibility**: Keep existing structure intact
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Add features incrementally
4. **Validation-Driven**: Use comprehensive validation at each step

### Data Sources Needed

1. **Professional Roles CSV**: Job roles with skill requirements
2. **Career Pathways CSV**: Progression routes between roles
3. **Competency Profiles CSV**: Detailed skill combinations
4. **Skill Relationships CSV**: Prerequisites and complementary skills

### Sample Data Structure

#### roles.csv
```csv
role_code,role_name,role_level,essential_skills,desirable_skills
SWARCH,Software Architect,6,"ITSP_6;ISCO_6;ARCH_6","TEAM_5;BUAN_4"
DEVLEAD,Development Team Lead,5,"PROG_5;TEAM_5;ARCH_4","ITSP_4;TECR_4"
```

#### pathways.csv
```csv
from_role,to_role,pathway_type,additional_skills_needed
DEVLEAD,SWARCH,progression,"ITSP_6;ARCH_6"
ANALYST,DEVLEAD,progression,"PROG_4;TEAM_4"
```

## Advanced Analytics Capabilities

### SPARQL Query Examples

#### Skill Gap Analysis
```sparql
SELECT ?skill ?requiredLevel ?currentLevel (?requiredLevel - ?currentLevel AS ?gap)
WHERE {
    roles:SWARCH sfia:requiresEssentialSkill ?targetSkillLevel .
    ?targetSkillLevel sfia:skill ?skill ; sfia:level ?requiredLevel .
    
    roles:DEVLEAD sfia:requiresEssentialSkill ?currentSkillLevel .
    ?currentSkillLevel sfia:skill ?skill ; sfia:level ?currentLevel .
    
    FILTER(?requiredLevel > ?currentLevel)
}
```

#### Career Progression Recommendations
```sparql
SELECT ?nextRole ?sharedSkills
WHERE {
    ?currentRole sfia:requiresEssentialSkill/sfia:skill ?commonSkill .
    ?nextRole sfia:requiresEssentialSkill/sfia:skill ?commonSkill .
    
    {
        SELECT ?currentRole ?nextRole (COUNT(?commonSkill) AS ?sharedSkills)
        WHERE {
            ?currentRole sfia:requiresEssentialSkill/sfia:skill ?commonSkill .
            ?nextRole sfia:requiresEssentialSkill/sfia:skill ?commonSkill .
        }
        GROUP BY ?currentRole ?nextRole
        HAVING(?sharedSkills >= 3)
    }
}
```
