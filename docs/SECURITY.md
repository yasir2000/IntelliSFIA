# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities. Which versions are eligible for receiving such patches depends on the CVSS v3.0 Rating:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

The IntelliSFIA team and community take security bugs seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

#### Email

Send an email to: **security@intellisfia.com**

Include the following information in your report:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any suggested fixes (if available)
- Your contact information for follow-up

#### Security Advisory

You can also report vulnerabilities through [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/yasir2000/IntelliSFIA/security/advisories) for this repository.

### What to Expect

You can expect to receive a response from us within **48 hours** indicating:
- Confirmation that we received your report
- Initial assessment of the vulnerability
- Timeline for investigation and potential fix

We will keep you informed of the progress towards resolving the issue and may ask for additional information or guidance.

### Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report received**: We acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: We investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix development**: We develop and test a fix
4. **Coordinated disclosure**: We coordinate the release of the fix
5. **Public disclosure**: We publicly disclose the vulnerability after the fix is available

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and interruption or degradation of our service
- Only interact with accounts you own or with explicit permission of the account holder
- Do not access a system or data beyond what is required to demonstrate the vulnerability
- Report vulnerabilities as soon as possible after discovery

### Scope

This security policy applies to:

#### In Scope
- All code in this repository
- Production deployments using official deployment configurations
- Official Docker images
- Dependencies explicitly managed by this project

#### Out of Scope
- Third-party services and dependencies (report to respective maintainers)
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical attacks
- Issues in development/testing environments
- Issues requiring physical access to servers

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
- Always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use secure authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Follow the principle of least privilege
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper error handling that doesn't leak sensitive information

#### For Deployments
- Use strong, unique passwords and API keys
- Enable TLS/SSL for all network communications
- Regularly update system and application dependencies
- Configure firewalls and network security groups appropriately
- Enable audit logging and monitoring
- Regular security scans and vulnerability assessments
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

#### For Users
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable two-factor authentication when available
- Keep your browser and system updated
- Be cautious of phishing attempts
- Report suspicious activities

### Common Security Issues

#### Authentication and Authorization
- Broken authentication mechanisms
- Session management flaws
- Privilege escalation vulnerabilities
- JWT token vulnerabilities

#### Data Protection
- SQL injection
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Insecure data storage
- Data exposure through APIs

#### Infrastructure Security
- Container security issues
- Kubernetes misconfigurations
- Network security problems
- SSL/TLS configuration issues

#### Dependency Vulnerabilities
- Outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities
- Supply chain attacks
- License compliance issues

### Security Testing

We regularly perform security testing including:
- **Static Application Security Testing (SAST)** using Semgrep
- **Dependency Scanning** using Trivy and npm audit
- **Container Scanning** for Docker images
- **Infrastructure as Code Scanning** for Kubernetes and Terraform
- **Penetration Testing** for production deployments

### Security Headers

Our application implements security headers including:
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)
- X-Frame-Options
- X-Content-Type-Options
- X-XSS-Protection
- Referrer-Policy

IntelliSFIA is designed to comply with:
- **GDPR** (General Data Protection Regulation)
- **SOC 2** (Service Organization Control 2)
- **ISO 27001** (Information Security Management)
- **OWASP Top 10** (Web Application Security Risks)

### Security Updates

Security updates will be:
- Released as soon as possible after vulnerability confirmation
- Documented in release notes with appropriate severity levels
- Communicated through multiple channels (GitHub, email, security advisories)
- Backported to supported versions when applicable

### Bug Bounty Program

We are currently evaluating the implementation of a bug bounty program. Updates will be posted here when available.

### Contact Information

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: security@intellisfia.com
- **Security Team**: Available 24/7 for critical vulnerabilities
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request for sensitive communications
