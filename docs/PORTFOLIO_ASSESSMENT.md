## IoC Methodology Details

### Technical Achievement Assessment (16 points)
- **Quality of Evidence** (0-4 points): Evidence-based vs assertion-based content
- **Technical Depth** (0-4 points): Complexity and sophistication of technical work
- **SFIA Alignment** (0-4 points): Accurate mapping to SFIA skills and levels
- **Innovation** (0-4 points): Creative problem-solving and novel approaches

### Reflection Assessment (9 points)
- **Self-Awareness** (0-3 points): Understanding of own skills and development
- **Learning Insights** (0-3 points): Reflection on learning process and outcomes
- **Future Planning** (0-3 points): Career development and skills roadmap

### Generic Responsibility Characteristics
Five key areas evaluated against SFIA level descriptors:
1. **Autonomy**: Independent decision-making capability
2. **Influence**: Ability to affect outcomes and stakeholder engagement
3. **Complexity**: Handling of complex problems and situations  
4. **Knowledge**: Technical and domain expertise demonstration
5. **Business Skills**: Commercial awareness and business context understanding

### Evidence Quality Criteria
- **Evidence-based Content**: Specific examples, metrics, outcomes, technical artifacts
- **Assertion-based Content**: General statements without supporting evidence
- **Quality Indicators**: Quantifiable results, peer validation, supervisor verification
- **Context Richness**: Detailed scenarios, challenges overcome, lessons learned

## Academic Institution Setup

### BCS RITTech Integration
```python
# Configure for BCS RITTech application
assessment_config = {
    "academic_context": "bcs_ritech",
    "accreditation_body": "bcs",
    "assessment_standards": "ritech_criteria",
    "evidence_requirements": "professional_body"
}
```

### IoC Accreditation Support
```python
# IoC-specific configuration
ioc_config = {
    "methodology": "ioc_portfolio_mapping",
    "scoring_weights": {
        "technical_achievement": 16,
        "reflection": 9
    },
    "proficiency_thresholds": {
        "competency": 85,
        "proficiency": 65,
        "developing": 0
    }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Complete Portfolio Assessment
```python
# Prepare portfolio data
portfolio_entries = [
    {
        "title": "Database Design Project",
        "description": "Designed and implemented relational database...",
        "evidence": "GitHub repository, performance metrics, peer review",
        "sfia_skills": ["DBDS"],
        "claimed_level": 4
    }
]

# Run IoC assessment
result = framework.assess_portfolio(
    portfolio_entries=portfolio_entries,
    academic_context="university_assessment",
    assessment_method="ioc_methodology"
)

print(f"Overall Score: {result.overall_score}/25")
print(f"Proficiency Level: {result.proficiency_level}")
```

### 2. Evidence Validation
```python
# Validate evidence quality
validation = framework.validate_portfolio_evidence(
    portfolio_entries=entries,
    quality_criteria="ioc_evidence_standards"
)

for entry in validation.entry_validations:
    print(f"Entry: {entry.title}")
    print(f"Evidence Quality: {entry.evidence_quality_score}/4")
    print(f"Suggestions: {entry.improvement_suggestions}")
```

### 3. Portfolio Template Generation
```python
# Generate portfolio template
template = framework.generate_portfolio_template(
    target_skills=["PROG", "DBDS", "SYDS"],
    target_level=4,
    academic_context="degree_assessment"
)

# Save template for students
with open("portfolio_template.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(template.to_dict(), f, indent=2)
