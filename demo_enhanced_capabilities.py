IntelliSFIA Enhanced AI Demonstration
====================================

This demo shows the ENHANCED capabilities that IntelliSFIA would have with:
1. CrewAI Multi-Agent System (5 specialized agents)
2. SFIA Semantic Ontology and Knowledge Base  
3. RDF/SPARQL reasoning and inference
4. Collaborative AI assessment workflow

Note: This is a simulation showing the enhanced capabilities.
For full implementation, install: pip install -r requirements-crewai.txt
