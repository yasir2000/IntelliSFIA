    sfia:attributeGuidanceNotes """Autonomy in SFIA represents a progression from following instructions to setting organisational strategy. It involves:

working under varying levels of direction and supervision
making independent decisions in line with responsibility
taking accountability for actions and their outcomes
delegating tasks and responsibilities appropriately
setting personal, team, or organisational goals.

Effective autonomy encompasses decision-making skills, self-management and the ability to balance independence with organisational goals. Autonomy is closely linked with skills such as decision-making, leadership, and planning.
As professionals advance, their level of autonomy increasingly shapes their ability to drive change, innovate and contribute to organisational success. As professionals advance, their autonomy enables them to lead initiatives and drive strategic outcomes.Â  At higher levels, individuals shape their role and make decisions that have a wider organisational impact, with minimal supervision."""@en ;
